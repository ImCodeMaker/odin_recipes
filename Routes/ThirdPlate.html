        <p>Recipe</p>

        <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For the Pasta Dough:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour (or "00" flour for a finer texture)</li>
                    <li>3 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil (optional)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <strong>Instructions:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Make the Dough:</strong> On a clean work surface, mound the flour and create a well in the center. Crack the eggs into the well, add the olive oil (if using), and sprinkle the salt around the edge of the flour. Using a fork, gently whisk the eggs, gradually incorporating the flour from the edges. As the mixture thickens, switch to using your hands to knead the dough until it comes together.</li>
            <li><strong>Knead the Dough:</strong> Knead the dough for about 8-10 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. If the dough feels too sticky, add a bit more flour; if it's too dry, add a few drops of water. Shape the dough into a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong> Divide the dough into 4 portions to make it easier to work with. On a lightly floured surface, flatten one portion of the dough with your hands or a rolling pin. Using a pasta machine, start at the widest setting and pass the dough through the rollers. Fold the dough in half and pass it through again. Repeat this process a few times to smooth the dough. Gradually reduce the width of the rollers and continue passing the dough through until it reaches your desired thickness (typically between settings 5 and 7 for most pasta shapes). If you don't have a pasta machine, you can roll the dough out by hand with a rolling pin, though it will take more time and effort.</li>
            <li><strong>Cut the Pasta:</strong> Once the dough is rolled out, cut it into your desired shape. For tagliatelle or fettuccine, fold the sheet of dough lightly and slice it into ribbons. For lasagna, cut the dough into large rectangles. For ravioli, cut the dough into squares or circles and fill them with your chosen filling before sealing. Lay the cut pasta on a lightly floured surface or a clean kitchen towel to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fresh pasta and cook for 2-4 minutes, depending on the thickness, until the pasta is al dente. Drain the pasta and toss it with your favorite sauce.</li>
        </ol>
