            Here's a basic recipe for making traditional Italian gelato at home:

            --Ingredients
            For the Base:
            2 cups (500 ml) whole milk
            1 cup (250 ml) heavy cream
            ¾ cup (150 g) granulated sugar
            4 large egg yolks (optional, for a richer texture)
            1 vanilla bean (or 1 tsp vanilla extract)
            For Flavor Variations:
            Chocolate Gelato: ⅓ cup (40 g) cocoa powder or 150 g melted dark chocolate
            Fruit Gelato: 1½ cups (300 g) fresh or frozen fruit puree (e.g., strawberries, mango, peaches)
            --Instructions
            1. Prepare the Gelato Base:
            In a medium saucepan, combine the milk, cream, and half of the sugar. If using a vanilla bean, split it
            open, scrape out the seeds, and add both the seeds and pod to the mixture.
            Heat the mixture over medium heat until it just begins to simmer, then remove from heat and let it infuse
            for 15-30 minutes.
            2. Make the Custard (Optional for Richer Gelato):
            In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and remaining sugar until pale and slightly thickened.
            Slowly pour the warm milk mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly to avoid curdling.
            Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens enough to
            coat the back of a spoon (about 170-175°F or 77-80°C).
            Strain the custard through a fine mesh sieve into a clean bowl to remove any solids and the vanilla pod.
            3. Add Flavorings:
            If making chocolate gelato, whisk in the cocoa powder or melted chocolate until smooth.
            If making fruit gelato, stir in the fruit puree.
            4. Chill the Mixture:
            Cover the gelato base with plastic wrap, pressing it directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from
            forming.
            Refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight, until thoroughly chilled.
            5. Churn and Freeze:
            Pour the chilled gelato mixture into an ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer’s
            instructions, usually about 20-30 minutes.
            Transfer the churned gelato to a lidded container and freeze for 2-3 hours to firm up.
            6. Serve:
            Scoop the gelato into bowls or cones and enjoy immediately, or store in the freezer for up to a week. Allow
            the gelato to soften at room temperature for a few minutes before serving if it becomes too firm.
